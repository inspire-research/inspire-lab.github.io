Welcome to the Intelligent Systems for Predictive Information Retrieval and Data Modeling (INSPIRE) Lab at Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada. We specialize in advancing the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and large language models. Our research aims to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and relevance of information retrieval systems through innovative algorithms and data modeling techniques. From semantic search to bias mitigation in recommender systems, our lab is dedicated to solving real-world challenges with interdisciplinary collaboration. Join us in pioneering the future of intelligent, adaptive, and user-centric information systems.
